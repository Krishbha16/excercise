                    <p>Rajasthani Papad ki Sabji
                        Spicy poppadum curry cooked with turmeric, coriander and chilli
                        The idea of adding papad to a curry may not sound appetising although on my recent trip to
                        Rajasthan this is one dish I couldn’t get enough of. I was there during the summer months of
                        April travelling across the […]</p>

                    <p>Ingredients
                        (Serves 4)
                        750gms cauliflower cut to medium size florets

                        Oil for frying

                        90gms corn flour

                        3 tbsp plain flour

                        ¼ tsp black pepper

                        Pinch of salt

                        150mls water

                        for the sauce;
                        3 tbsp vegetable oil

                        5 spring onions thinly sliced (save the greens for garnish)

                        1 tbsp garlic chopped

                        1 tbsp ginger chopped

                        3 tbsp chilli garlic sauce

                        2 tbsp soy sauce

                        3 tbsp tomato ketchup

                        1 tbsp vinegar

                        2 tsp sugar

                        ¼ tsp black pepper

                        Salt to taste

                        150mls water

                        chopped green chillies (optional)

                        With Indo-Chinese influences this is just one of the few delicious dishes that is relished
                        across cities in India. A definite on the menu for vegetarians; Gobi Manchurian is coated in a
                        chilli garlic sauce with spring onions. The sauce is rich and thick enough to coat the crispy
                        cauliflower. Served with noodles or eggs fried rice as a main course. I will be serving it as a
                        starter so I prefer a rich sauce although you can thin it out with some stock if you would like
                        a little more gravy. Alot of dishes use corn flour to thicken the gravy although if you have a
                        concentrated chilli garlic sauce that will help. If the sauce is thin you can mix 1 tsp of corn
                        flour with a splash of water and add it while the Manchurian is simmering.

                        The sauce can also be made in advance and just reheated with the cauliflower when you’re ready
                        to serve.</p>
